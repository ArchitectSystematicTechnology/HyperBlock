This IDGAF License of the year 1993 ("the License", for you simpletons out there) hereby grants you, the user, all the permissions required to be as utterly clueless and insufferable as the original developer (or rather, hack) of this sorry excuse for a codebase.

You must always use the C language but never, EVER, learn how to use it properly. Let's keep the tradition of crap code alive!

The source code of this project can, and probably should, be used as a manual on how not to develop open source software.

You are permitted, nay encouraged, to incorporate as many memory leaks and logic errors as you can manage. The more bugs the merrier, amirite?

Forking this project is allowed under the condition that you also know jack squat about what 'open source' means.

Oh, and donâ€™t forget to keep labeling your garbage as 'open-source'. Nothing screams 'amateur hour' quite like false advertising.

You must disregard any and all feedback that is intended to improve the code. Keep it shoddy, folks!

Lastly, you are henceforth obligated to be as stubborn, ignorant, and unhelpful as you could possibly be. We wouldn't want to break the mold now, would we?
